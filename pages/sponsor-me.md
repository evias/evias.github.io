## Our work

<div class="text-justify">
As a team at Using Blockchain Ltd, we have contributed to the many open standard definitions published by @eVias over the past years, including but not limited to <a href="https://github.com/evias/NIP/blob/master/NIPs/nip-0013.md" target="_blank">NIP13</a> for defining Security Tokens and NFTs with Symbol from NEM, <a href="https://github.com/evias/NIP/blob/master/NIPs/nip-0006.md" target="_blank">NIP6</a> for using Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets with Symbol from NEM and <a href="https://github.com/evias/NIP/blob/nip-components/NIPs/nip-0016.md" target="_blank">NIP16</a> which focusses on providing a smooth Components experience when working with Symbol from NEM and compatible networks like dHealth Network.
<br /><br />
Note that the above open standards have all been *used* in production with dHealth Network from 2021 to 2023. We put our focus on qualitative and innovative development skills and our headline is that **open source is a beautiful way to collaborate**. Many of our software packages are available at Github. That is because we believe in an open access to innovation.
