I am Gr√©gory Saive, born and raised in Belgium ; active Spanish citizen, I stepped
into software at the age of 12, driven mostly by the hobby of my father.

If you find yourself reading this, it is probable that you are willing to find
out more about my professional aptitudes and professional experience. My passion
for software has been driving me for about 23 years now and I have designed-,
worked with-, authored-, developed- and maintained many different software projects
that I have the [rather good] habit of sharing with others using open-source
licenses.
<br /><br />
I worked with many different technology stacks during my career: that includes
using basic communication protocols like IRC; also, defining chat protocols
with Websockets; or defining cryptographic standards for key and data exchange.
