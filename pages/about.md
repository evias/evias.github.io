# **About Me**

<div class="row">
I am Gr√©gory Saive, born and raised in Belgium - I stepped into software at the
age of 12, driven by the hobby of my father and a friend of mine who was learning
C++.

Here I am, 23 years later, still passionate about software development. That is
mostly because software can be taught to do anything. I worked with many different
technology stacks during my career- from using basic communication protocols
including IRC, to defining chat protocols with Websockets, via defining cryptographic
standards for key exchanges or ring signatures, to deterministic key derivation
algorithms. 

I am also the founder of <a href="https://ubc.digital" target="_blank">UBC Digital</a>,
a company by pioneers of the Bitcoin and blockchain industry with the aim to
streamline the integration of distributed ledger technology for mainstream media
and the business industry. Our team of experts will help your software project
thrive, adapt and scale to an ever-changing digital era!
