This project contains the source code for a **simplistic blockchain network** as
showcased in [UBC Digital Magazine][parent-url].

This library can be used to *teach* topics including: **algorithmic mining**,
**blockchain integrity verification**, **mining difficulty** and more generally
some concepts of **public-key cryptography** with signature verifications.

## Installation

The installation is very straight forward with just one command to execute:

```bash
cd /path/to/this/clone
npm install -g @ubcdigital/chaints
```

A list of example use cases is available at [Github][code-url].
