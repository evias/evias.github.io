description: In this third episode of the Making blockchain real (MBR) Series, we take a look at Disposable Smart Contracts and apply
            their utility using a blockchain (P2P) network. These smart contracts are said to be "ephemeral" or "short-lived" because
            their lifecycle is limited. This publication illustrates this with examples.
