description: In this podcast with dHealth, I answer to an AMA - short for Ask Me Anything - about the blockchain protocol and
            about how the community can join in building the future of healthcare. This podcast goes on about some of the feats
            that make dHealth Network so attractive as a public blockchain infrastructure for Healthcare.
