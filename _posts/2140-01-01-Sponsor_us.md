## Who is who

I am Grégory Saive, Founder and CEO of UBC Digital, previously member of the late *NEM Project Management Committee* focussing on **Symbol from NEM** where I lead the development of Client Software as the Head of Development of the NEM.io Foundation. I later acted as a **Blockchain Lead** for dHealth Network, taking the role of a core developer in the project to revolutionize the healthcare industry with my blockchain skills!

My team at is composed of Bitcoin and blockchain pioneers that focus most of their time on open source projects and open standards. Reach out to us to find out more about our team!

## Our work

As a team at Using Blockchain Ltd, we have contributed to the many open standard definitions published by @eVias over the past years, including but not limited to [NIP-13](https://github.com/evias/NIP/blob/master/NIPs/nip-0013.md) for defining Security Tokens and NFTs with Symbol from NEM, [NIP-6](https://github.com/evias/NIP/blob/master/NIPs/nip-0006.md) for using Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets with Symbol from NEM and [NIP-16](https://github.com/evias/NIP/blob/nip-components/NIPs/nip-0016.md) which focusses on providing a smooth Components experience when working with Symbol from NEM.

Note that the above open standards have all been *used* in production with dHealth Network from 2021 to 2023. We put our focus on qualitative and innovative development skills and our headline is that **open source is a beautiful way to collaborate**. Many of our software packages are available at Github. That is because we believe in an open access to innovation.
